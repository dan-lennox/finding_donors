    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve.

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of choosing a model that can correctly identify individuals who make more than $50,000 led to the initial evaluations of three popular machine learning models. The models chosen were the Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, we determined that due to the need for model precision, F Score performance would be a more important metric than a general Accuracy Score. Looking at the F Score performance, when evaluated on 100\\% of the available test data, for each of the three models, we can see that all three models perform almost equally well on the test data. What this means is that in their current state, all three models are roughly equally capable of potentially predicting the result of unseen data. However keep in mind that we have not yet optimised any of these models. So in deciding which model to recommend we needed to consider which of these models has the highest potential for improved performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final recommendation is therefore, that the Random Forest algorithm is the most appropriate model for the job. The Random Forest algorithm had near perfect Accuracy Score and F Score performance on 100\\% of the training data set. This is usually a sign that the model has simply memorised the training set (overfitting). However, despite this poor indicator, the Random Forest model still performs just as well on the test set as the other models. The other models, in contrast, perform similarly well on both the training and tests sets. In our opinion, this descrepancy with the Random Forest model indicates that with proper hyper parameter tuning, the Random Forest model could be trained to generalise to unseen data far better than it currently is. We are confident that this will likely result in stronger performance on the testing set and as a result, better future predictions. Additionally the Random Forest algorithm has been identified as a generally suitable algorithm for the type of problem we are trying to solve. It has concrete real world applications for every similar problems, such as identifying potential customers that might buy products in an e-commerce context. It also works well with categorical data, of which our dataset has plenty of, and is also generally known for producing accurate results, meaning we'll hopefully avoiding mis-classifying lower earning individuals as higher earning individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another observation was that the SVM model took far longer to both train and predict than the Random Forest or Logisitic Regression models. However, assuming that further training is not required on exponentially larger datasets, these performance differences are relatively negligable in practice. This combined with the previous arguments advocating for the use of the Random Forest algorithm mean that this observation on SVM performance did not have much of an impact on the final model recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "@TODO: Subsequent runs of the training indicate that performance hit is much larger! Maybe re-adjust my statement above."

Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction.

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest machine learning model is actually what's called an Ensemble Method. This means that it consists of several simpler models, called weak learners, working together to produce a stronger prediction. With Random Forests, the udnerlying simpler model is called a Decision Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees make predictions by taking unseen data, such as a potential new charity donor, and asking a series of questions about that data. Eventually, in our case, the model will ask enough questions that it will eventually have enough information to decide if an individual earns more thank $50,000. The training of the decision tree model consists of deciding which questions to ask and in what order, with the answer to each question leading to a new question, forming a tree like structure. An example question might be, \"Is the individual Male or Female?\", which relates to one the columns, called features, in our dataset. The model determines the importance of these questions and therefore their position in the tree, by measuring the amount of information that was gained about the dataset by answering the question. The extent to which a question reduces uncertaintiy about the dataset and increases knowledge of the dataset determines how early in the tree that question is asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are great for producing accurate results. However sometimes, expecially when there is a relatively high number of features (such as with our dataset), they simply memorise the data with which they are trained. This means they might not be very good at making predictions with new data. This is where the Random Forest model comes to the rescue. The Random Forest model consists of many Decision Tree models. However, each of these Decision Tree models is only trained on a random subset of the feature columns in our data. What happens when we use our Random Forest to predict how much a new individual earns is that each of these sub decision tree's makes it's own invididual prediction. The final \"answer\", in our case less than or equal to $50,000 or higher than $50,000, is the answer which was produced by the highest number of these sub trees. This ensures that the Random Forest model isn't simply memorising the original training dataset and will potentially do a great job of making predictions for new individuals.\n",

    "### Implementation: Model Tuning\n",
    "Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.\n",

    "1. occupation\n",
    "\n",
    "The occupation of an individual often determines how much income they earn. This is because various occupations require different skills, knowledge and are in different levels of scarcity and demand for talent. It's highly likely that income and occupation are correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. capital-gain\n",
    "\n",
    "An individual with a high captial gain is likely to have accumulated assets such as stocks or property. Therefore it's likely that there would be a correlation between higher incomes for these individuals and their ability to afford to own such assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. education-level\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the individuals in this data set are from the USA. It is well known that in the United States there is a wide incomed disparity between those with college degrees and those without. So therefore it's likely there would be a correlation between the education level of an individual and their income.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. age\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, individuals start their careers at a young age and their pay tends to increase as they gain further experience and expertise, while at the same time growing older. With experience and expertise generally comes increased incomes, although the amount of increase depends on other factors such as occupation. In a general sense, there should be a correlation between the age of an individual and the amount of income they earn.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Sex\n",
    "\n",
    "There's still a known gender pay gap in the United States (where most of the individuals in this dataset are from), so income and gender would very likely have a correlation in this dataset. In particular, it can be observed that there is sexism at play in positions of wealth and power and so regardless of the pay gap, women might often be less likely to obtain some higher paying positions at all.\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "I only managed to select two out of the five features correctly on intuition! I managed to select _capital-gain_ and _age_. But missed _hours-per-week_ and _maritial-status_ and instead selected _sex_ and _occupation_. I think my intuition was correct with regards to _education-num_, however I selected the wrong feature in _education_level_.\n",
    "\n",
    "- education-num vs education_level\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought some aspect of a person's education would factor highly. However I assumed that the actual formal education_level might have a stronger importance. It might be that education-num has a higher importance with regards to the model predictions because it is a continuos rather than a categorical feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- marital-status\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, I did not expect that this feature would be all that important and was surprised to see this feature included in the top five. I perhaps thought that marital status \n",
    "\n",
    "- capital-gain\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital gain was one of the two features I managed to select correctly on intuition. It makes sense that individual's with appreciating assets might be more likely to have a higher income.\n",
    "\n",
    "- hours-per-week\n",
    "\n",
    "I did not expect this feature to be part of the top five most important. I had assumed that hours-per-week simply predicted overtime and that both high and low paying job's sometimes require overtime and so therefore might balance each other out. The feature importance extraction results show my assumption was shallow and didn't really take into account that much of that overtime might have been payed, enough so to bring certain lower paying jobs above the $50,000 threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "- age\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the second of the two features I managed to select correctly, although I did not rank it high enough to match it's actual performance. The high importance of age makes perfect sense and it was good to see this confirmed via the feature importance analysis. In my initial assumption, I highlighted the general rise in income that can occur as a person ages and simultaneously gains experience, seniority and therefore income. However I failed to mention that income can peak mid-late career. Perhaps this additional relationship accounts for the stronger than expected feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- occupation\n",
    "\n",
    "This was my top ranked selection based on intuition. I was very surprised to see this feature did not make the top five most importance features at all. Perhaps what I overlooked was the fact that various occupations have different incomes that relate to different experience levels within those occupations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- sex\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems I have misjudged the employers of the individuals in this particular dataset! Despite my assumption that gender might result in wide enough pay gaps to result in more men being above the $50,000 threshold, the feature importance extraction results indicate that if such pay gaps exist, they aren't often large enough to often cause a male individual to earn above the $50,000 threshold while a similar female stays below it.\n"

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "_How does the final model's F-score and accuracy score on the reduced data using only five features compare to those same scores when all features are used?_\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the accuracy and F-score DECREASE when using the reduced data. However, given that we are now using only five out of thirteen features, the result is impressive, since it's only slightly less than the performance when using the full data set. Put another way, we could say that the addition of an extra eight features (beyond the five most important ones), only adds an additional one percentage point to the accuracy score and just over two percentage points to the F-score. The five most important features really do appear to be responsible for most of the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "_If training time was a factor, would you consider using the reduced data as your training set?_\n",
    "\n",
    "If, for instance, we were dealing with much larger datasets, then it might make sense to use the reduced data, consisting of only the five most important features, for training and prediction. It's clear from our results above that taking this approach would only slightly decrease the performance of the model. However, special care might need to be taken to ensure the two percentage point difference in the F-score does not become a significant problem in practice, due to the importance of precision to CharityML as stated earlier. Perhaps adding the sixth and seventh most important features could reduce the margin down to one or perhaps half a percentage point. I believe this would be worth experimenting with as using six or seven features should still take far less computation time than the full set of thirteen.\n"
